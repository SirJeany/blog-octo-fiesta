 + Caorousel on small devices: Perhaps make the image smaller?
 + Change login.js to request and not get db info directly
 + Error with adding new posts as create-post increments id by checking db directly
The big move to the general viewer:
 + Landing page should have a short and clear decription of what is being expected of the user.
 + Should make only you U/D own posts.

Suggestions:
Aimee: 
 + Author's name should be the logged-in's name
 + Save functionality: There should be a publish AND save (keeping it as a draft) to be published later
 + Author bottom: A little bio area for the Author.
Kristi suggestions:
 + Allow social media handles
 + Fix some sizing issues - some texts just too big, overshadowing other important parts of the page...
