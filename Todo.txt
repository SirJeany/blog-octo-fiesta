 + More informative registration: Have a landing page for newly registered users, asking them to log in.
 + Caorousel on small devices: Perhaps make the image smaller?
 + Create-post is still accessible to someone not logged in (by typing in the url)
The big move to the general viewer:
 + Landing page should have a short and clear decription of what is being expected of the user - todo on the register-success page
 + Should make only you U/D own posts.

Suggestions:
Aimee:
 + Author's name should be the logged-in's name
 + Save functionality: There should be a publish AND save (keeping it as a draft) to be published later
 + Author bottom: A little bio area for the Author.
Kristi suggestions:
