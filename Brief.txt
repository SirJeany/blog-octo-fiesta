Brief for project:

Build a blog. 
Allow users to log in, post and update articles.
The blog should be about the users interests and hobbies.
The user would need to be logged in to update and post.

Fully functional req:
1) Home page - displaying an overview of what the blog is  about
2) The blog should be highly visual - high res crispy imgs that are not too big still
3) Home page has a banner/hero img. 
4) SHowcase at least 3 of the latest blog posts.
5) NEW POST PAGE: User has the option of creating a new post.
	5.1) New post should have the following fields: Title, Content, Author (the user), Featured img, date field.
6) In order to update or create you need to add rich text in order to style articles - this requires a third party wysiwyg
7) EDIT POST PAGE: User should be able to edit the existing blog post. 
8) ARCHIVE PAGE: A page which displays all the blog posts of a user
9) You will need a single post page (a view for a particular blog post) - but also list some blog posts that are related
to this current post on the side (or bottom).

10) Registration and signup page - if a user is not registered/signed in then they cant CUD (but can read)
	- So user will be able to see the view page and home page.
