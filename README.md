# Blog-octo-fiesta
## A Maven Academy project.
We're tasked with creating a blog (which contains some of our own material) in order to test our understanding of:
  - Front end + responsiveness.
  - Node and Express.
  - Handling data through a JSON mock database [as a BONUS try implement MONGO DB].


## Get started:
  - Clone repository.
  - npm install json-server -g
