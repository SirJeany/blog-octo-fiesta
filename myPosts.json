We were searching for the warmer waters of the eastern coast, or looking back on it, were we running? We left behind our families, our troubles, and some of us our partners - perhaps we would never see them again.</p><p style=\"margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px; text-align: justify; font-family: &quot;Open Sans&quot;, Arial, sans-serif;\"><br></p><p style=\"margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px; text-align: justify; font-family: &quot;Open Sans&quot;, Arial, sans-serif;\"></p><div class=\"post-image\"><img src=\"/images/IMG_2508.JPG\"></div><p></p><p style=\"margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px; text-align: justify; font-family: &quot;Open Sans&quot;, Arial, sans-serif;\"><b>The madmen: Alexander Ofemi on the left and Twinkle Toes on the right.

Like the rising sun he brought warmness and light into our day as soon as he was in the room. I remember Ofemi's tear roll down his nose onto Toes' face and into his blood-filled mouth that evening. He'd been battling anthropogenic meningitis all his life, what started out as another evening, flooding our worries away with wine, ended with him sprawled out on the floor, gasping for breath as Ofemi held him in his arms as gently as mother would her wounded child. Through the bubbling of blood, he managed to slip his final words: 'Mo.. moo.. Mon-con-con'. And with that Ofemi close his brother's eyes and said; 'You too, my sunset'.</p><p style=\"margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px; text-align: justify; font-family: &quot;Open Sans&quot;, Arial, sans-serif;\"><br></p><p style=\"margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px; text-align: justify; font-family: &quot;Open Sans&quot;, Arial, sans-serif;\">Skoobs to the end.</p>",
